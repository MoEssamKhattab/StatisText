# StatisText
A .Net (C#) based GUI-application that performs some statistical analysis on a .txt file, mapping the numbers (0-9) and the letters, both uppercase and lowercase letters, into random variables (RVs). Moreover, StatisText computes both PMF and CDF of each RV in addition to some statistical moments (e.g. mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis).
